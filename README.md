Here's a quick overview of my latest project in data analysis: a dynamic and visually interactive Bike Sales Dashboard built in Excel. It includes:

ðŸ”¹ Income Analysis: Displays the relationship between average income and bike purchases by gender.

ðŸ”¹ Demographics: Highlights customer purchasing trends across different age groups (adolescent, middle-aged, old).

ðŸ”¹ Commute Patterns: Examines bike purchase behavior by commute distance.

ðŸ”¹ Geographical and Educational Insights: Incorporates region and education levels for deeper analysis.

This dashboard provides actionable insights into customer preferences, helping businesses strategize effectively.
